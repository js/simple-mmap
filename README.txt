= simple_mmap

http://simple-mmap.rubyforge.org/

== DESCRIPTION:

  A simplistic interface for reading memory mapped files

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* mmap a file. Read data from it. Close it when you're done. More fun than the "ball in a cup" game.
* it ONLY supports reading mmap'ed files, not writing to the mmap'ed region

== SYNOPSIS:
  
>> fw = SimpleMmap::FileWindow.open("path/to/large/file")
>> fw[23467, 200] #=> data between byte 23467 and the next 200 bytes
# works with the same semantics as Array#[] (eg. fw[10..14] and fw[10...14])
>> fw.close # you MUST close the FileWindow after you're done (HAHA no blocks for you yet!)


== REQUIREMENTS:

* A mmap() capable platform.

== INSTALL:

$ gem install simple_mmap
# If you have ruby 1.9+ built with executables having a program-suffix:
$ env rake=rake1.9 gem install simple_mmap
